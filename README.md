# simpleimageviewer

Displays a PNG or JPG image file without any UI other than a simple border. Menu is access through a right-click-context. Written in Java using JavaFX for the GUI. Open multiple simple image viewers and make a collage! Move similar images side by side and make an easier comparison without a bloated GUI in the way. Admire the art without the bells and whistles distracting from the view. Save screen space.
